Reference and collaboration 

I worked on this myself with no classmate.

I used class notes and node.js documentations.
Github interface files
I used HTTP status codes website
W3SCHOOLS  - java script handling.
I also used my previous homeworks as references.
Also used professors notes and slides. 
Also used a new website called "GeeksforGeeks" to help me structure the codes. 


-Thank YOu
