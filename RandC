Hello

Student Name: Qasim Khan
Student ID: 70565374

## Working Style
   I worked on this homework (homework 2) alone.


# Resources
-I use what I always use is node.js documentations ( HTTP Modules, URL Modules)
- Class materials
- Docs and javascript references (Java Script guide) (JavaScript array methods,objects,switch)
- W3Schools



These are the resources/references I used and I worked on this alone at home/library.
